  itTakesTeamwork:
    'Believe it or not, our team gets this question all the time: who’s responsible for the institution "winning" the MPPWSA award? This question has been raised by governing board members, university presidents, provosts, and, in some cases, from senior student affairs officers themselves. Usually, the question seeks to identify <i>the person</i> or <i>the office</i> that deserves credit for earning the national recognition. After managing this project for a full decade, here’s what we have learned: “There’s no ‘I’ in MPPWSA” and there’s good reason for it. Earning this national recognition requires <i>true teamwork</i> and winning institutions make it a campus-wide priority.<p>It may sound cliché, but achieving diversity is everyone’s job. No single person or unit can do it all, nor should they. It takes a village — well, a team — to promote diversity, achieve equity, foster inclusion, pursue justice, and boost belonging in higher education workplaces, including student affairs. These terms must be more than buzzwords and deeply infuse day-to-day operations, campus policies, HR practices, and business intelligence. Winning institutions know the difference between them and use that understanding to bring talented people in as staff and leaders, to remove systemic barriers that shut some people out, and to ensure that all staff members feel heard, seen, and visible as reflected in the institution’s staff profile, equitable pay structure, core values, and DEI practices, to give a few examples.</p><p>There are many versions of this in the public domain, but we present this as a basic guide for readers. Diversity asks: <i>Who’s present?</i> Equity asks: <i>Who’s (still) attempting to enter the room but can’t? What obstacles exist, seen and unseen?</i> Inclusion asks: <i>Are all people’s opinions heard, valued, and understood?</i> Belonging asks: <i>Does everyone in the room feel respected and free to be themselves, just as they are?</i> Justice asks: <i>How, or why, are our systems harming or limiting people?  How do we fix them?</i> And, all of these come together in a way that leads to action to achieve positive results, while paying attention to people’s experiences along the way.</p><p><i>Promising Places</i> create a culture of evidence-based decisionmaking that leads to implementation, experimentation, and even revision of promising practices, policies, and programs like those mentioned in this year’s report. It’s not that they do <i>one thing well</i>, but they have developed a constellation of supportive policies, equity-minded practices, and cutting-edge DEI practices that provide employees, particularly those in student affairs, with a positive work environment, equitable pay, opportunities for advancement, and meaningful work that contributes to the institution’s bottom line and their personal/professional goals.</p><p>On many campuses, promising practices, programs, and services are "housed" across divisions. They’re in human resources and talent management. Diversity and inclusion. Academic and student affairs. Athletics and intramural sports, to name a few. So, the answer to the question "who’s responsible" is simple: everyone! When the institution wins, everyone wins.</p><p>Again, congratulations to this year’s highly selective set of <i>Most Promising Places to Work in Student Affairs!</i></p>',
  study:
    '<p>This study was first proposed by Ralph Newell at <i>Diverse: Issues in Higher Education</i> as a possible partnership with the American College Personnel Association (ACPA) in 2011. The ACPA Governing Board motioned for the then director of research and scholarship, Dr. Terrell Strayhorn, to explore the merit and extent of this project. With input from a volunteer advisory board, the project was recommended to the governing board and approved.</p><p>Strayhorn was commissioned by ACPA and <i>Diverse: Issues in Higher Education</i> to serve as the project’s principal investigator. In this role, Strayhorn developed the Promising Places to Work in Student Affairs (MPPWSA) Survey in consultation with experts on the project’s advisory board. The original survey was pilot-tested with a small sample of non-ACPA member institutions; feedback from the pilot-test helped to clarify survey items, correct logic sequencing, and determine the utility of our scoring algorithm.</p><p>The purpose of this commissioned study was to examine the extent to which diversity and inclusion permeates aspects of various divisions of student affairs (or equivalent) at participating ACPA-member institutions across the globe including administrative structures, core values, short- and long-term commitments, work environments, and staffing practices.</p>',
  survey:
    '<p>The MPPWSA survey consists of approximately 60 items, organized into 10 major sections. For example, one section elicits contact information for the survey respondent and identifying information about their respective institution (e.g., control, minority-serving institution [MSI] status). Another section includes several items to assess the structural diversity of the institution and student affairs department in terms of gender, race, sexual orientation, and disability status. There are several sections that measure the availability and extent of best-in-class support services provided to student affairs staff on campus, such as stress reduction programs, educational leave, flexible work arrangements, and professional development.</p><p>The survey was authored by Dr. Terrell Strayhorn, with input from experts on the project advisory board, and is not available in the public domain. Now part of the larger ’Promising Places to Work’ project, the survey has been administered by Strayhorn and his teams at various centers and Do Good Work Professional Consulting Group. All survey rights belong to the author. All analyses presented in this edition were conducted by Strayhorn and Dr. Royel Johnson.</p>',

  promisingPractices:
    '<p>Promising practices are specific, actionable insights that were gleaned from survey data and one-on-one or group interviews with teams of student affairs practitioners from the most promising places to work. These <i>Promising Practices</i> are not necessarily “best practices,” per se—as what works well on one campus may not achieve the same results on another. Instead, we present them as <i>promising practices</i> that according to annual and trend lines for MPPWSA seem to have potential for consistently producing desirable outcomes in practice.</p>',
  commitment:
    '<p>Beyond the development of taskforces and strategic plans for achieving diversity or inclusive excellence within their division, senior leaders at this year’s Most Promising Places to Work in Student Affairs (MPPWSA) <u>maintained</u> very clear commitments to the translation and implementation of such efforts within their day-to-day operations. For example, one vice president commissioned a committee to develop a comprehensive guide for the recruitment and retention of diverse staff. Grounded in empirical research related to multiculturalism in education and social justice, this guide offers hiring committees and managers actionable items to follow to achieve the diversity they envision for their unit. As another example, staff on another MPPWSA campus are encouraged to discuss hiring goals with human resources (HR) recruiters and to request full view of candidates without pre-screening. This strategy helps ensure that all candidates are carefully considered and it empowers the team to make decisions about who they’re looking for and the skills needed in potential applicants.<p/><p>Ensuring inclusive excellence in student affairs is hard work. It requires that we move beyond rhetoric—the mere acknowledgment that diversity is important—to action. Leaders at this year’s MPPWSA institutions have taken bold new steps for <u>sustained</u> transformational change within their division. We encourage SSAOs across the country to also engage in the necessary, and sometimes difficult, decision-making required for recruiting, retaining, and promoting diverse staff within their divisions. Insights from this year’s featured institutions indicate this might include partnering with HBCUs, rewarding educational achievements, and periodically reviewing job descriptions to ensure alignment between <i>what one does and what one was hired to do.</i></p><p>Of course, the progress of some MPPWSA institutions may eclipse the current status of others. Indeed, each year we welcome newcomers to the list of MPPWSA institutions—hats off to all those who have been named for the first time in 2025! We also acknowledge that some former MPPWSA institutions are not in this year’s lineup, which has been true every year of the project. Generally, such changes in the lineup can be attributed to (1) <i>significant</i> improvements and sustained focused efforts on the part of prior MPPWSAs (2) entry of newcomers to the annual competition who outpace others on key metrics and (3) changes/declines in supports and services of past recipients. Interestingly, our research team has also observed that movement on- and off-the-list is also correlated with crisis management, government policies toward DEI, and leadership turnover, especially in vital student services areas. For example, several former MPPWSA schools experienced a significant setback in their standing this year, primarily due to the introduction and enforcement of anti-DEI legislation in their state or local area. Campus sources have shared that such legislation critically impacted their ability to “deliver on the promise of a diverse and inclusive workplace” by reducing, if not outright eliminating, funding and support for crucial initiatives. Key programs vary by institution but include without limits: diversity incentive grants, identity-based employee resources groups (ERGs), anti-racism workshops, book clubs, and so much more. Lack of financial and legislative support for these programs not only undermines the school’s efforts to maintain and enhance humanizing student affairs workplaces, but also significantly detracts from their ability to create inclusive environments where all staff can thrive regardless of department or functional area. Consequently, these conditions can decrease one’s competitiveness for the award, highlighting the profound impact state policies can have on higher education institutions and their capacity to live up to their core mission. </p><p>Being recognized as a MPPWSA is a prestigious accolade that reflects an institution’s commitment to fostering a supportive and inclusive environment within student affairs at a specific point in time. This evaluation is based on a comprehensive analysis of various performance indicators, with a particular focus on identifying year-to-year changes that might influence an institution’s standing. It’s important to note that the design of this study is inherently sensitive to fluctuations, including shifts, declines, or drop-offs in effective institutional practices and policies. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, several MPPWSA-recognized institutions implemented innovative practices such as flexible work hours, telework options, and fuel assistance to better support their remote workforce. However, as some institutions pivot back to ‘in-person only’ models, these commendable practices have been discontinued. This transition presents an opportunity for leaders to creatively design new or revise existing programs and services. Such initiatives can continue the momentum gained during COVID, while also more effectively promoting diversity and inclusion amid new norms. The dynamic nature of the MPPWSA project encourages continuous improvement, incremental adaptation, and future-focused growth mindedness to ensure that institutions remain on the cutting-edge. Thus, we encourage readers of this special report and senior-most leaders of higher education institutions to consider these recommendations when fashioning productive work environments, promoting inclusive excellence, and managing institutional change caused by unanticipated crises, policy changes, or leadership transitions brought about by a number of headwinds. Remember this: <b>Doing the same thing well consistently over time or doing ‘good work’ increasingly better over time has greater impact than doing something great once!</b></p>',
  encourageWork:
    '<p>In addition to excelling in their assigned role or position, staff at many MPPWSA institutions were incentivized to work on projects outside of their normal division and function. For an example of how allowing work across silos contributes to a promising place to work, take a look at this year’s featured institutions in terms of dining services, counseling services, academic advising, and financial aid, to name a few. One reason for the success of these campus services is a result of the cross pollination that occurred when they were encouraged to share ideas across units on how to best serve diverse faculty, staff, and students. Mixing of creative ideas, effective strategies, and deeper understandings of campus needs led to innovations like campus-sponsored food pantries, vegan/vegetarian diet options, university-sanctioned clothing closets, emergency aid grants, year-round housing and dining services, veteran support services, and reemployment assistance for staff. Readers of this year’s report might consider these examples when developing strategic plans or staffing practices of their own.</p>',
  fostering:
    '<p>Enabling staff to work across invisible “functional walls” that separate teams and divisions also helped many of this year’s MPPWSA institutions to provide workplace environments where faculty and staff feel like they belong, they matter, and they make an important contribution. It is important to note that the mere provision of professional supports and services is unlikely to produce robust outcomes like workplace belonging—it is when staff support and services are intentionally designed to address the basic and specific needs of personnel and remove structural inequities, which affirming their value and contributions, that leads to higher belonging, greater productivity, and success. For instance, several of this year’s MPPWSA institutions offer various forms of professional leave (e.g., caregiving, educational) to staff to accommodate their academic aspirations and family needs. Other institutions offer stress reduction programs (e.g., virtual yoga), flexible workhours (even pre- or post-pandemic), merit pay or bonuses, and childcare services to demonstrate an institutional commitment to work-life balance, family-friendliness, and holistic development. They also offer a suite of professional awards and rewards, recognizing the employee of the month, those who ‘go beyond the call of duty,’ those who celebrate key milestones (e.g., 5-, 10-, 15-years of employment), as well as those who retire or leave the institution for a promotion or new opportunity.</p>',
